# self-consistent-1D-Schr-dinger-Poisson-on-a-non-uniform-mesh
Schr√∂dinger gives the quantum mechanical states electrons can occupy.  Poisson enforces electrostatic self-consistency (electrons repel each other, modifying the potential).  Solving them together captures the true equilibrium between quantum confinement and electrostatics.
